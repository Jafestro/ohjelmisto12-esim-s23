<!-- In the Harry Potter children's books, the sorting hat assigns a new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry to one of the four classes, which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Write an
electronic sorting hat that asks for a student's name and draws a room for him. If you enter Anna as the name,
for example, the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are Ravenclaw." (3p)-->
